You have the power to heal your life, and you need to know that.
If you have to ask you will never know, if you know you need only ask.
Your memory is the glue that binds your life together.
Most of all I want to sleep. I want to sleep like I slept when I was a boy. Give me that. Just one time. That's why I won't allow that punk out there to get the best of me. Let alone the last of me.
Gold and rose, the color of the dream I had not too long ago. A misty blue and the lilac, too, never to grow old. There you were under the tree of song, sleeping so peacefully. In your hand a flower played, awaiting there for me. I have never laid eyes on you, not before this timeless day, but you walked and you once smiled my name, and you stole my heart away.
