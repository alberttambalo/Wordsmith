You have the power to heal your life, and you need to know that.
If you have to ask you will never know, if you know you need only ask.
Your memory is the glue that binds your life together.
If you don't know what you want, how are you going to know when you get it?
You can't use the fire exit because you're not made of fire.
Dreams are only dreams until you wake up and make them real.
Sometimes the world as you know it just decides to become something else.
It's easy not to abuse your power when you don't actually have any power.
I'm going to take my time. I have all the time in the world.
When we remember we only get a version of the last time we remember it.

Most of all I want to sleep. I want to sleep like I slept when I was a boy. Give me that. Just one time. That's why I won't allow that punk out there to get the best of me. Let alone the last of me.
It's a human sign when things go wrong, when the scent of her lingers and temptation's strong. Into the boundary of each married man, sweet deceit comes calling and negativity lands.
I sit at my table and wage war on myself. It seems like it's all, it's all for nothing. I know the barricades and I know the mortar in the wall breaks. I recognize the weapons, I used them well. This is my mistake. Let me make it good. I raised the wall and I will be the one to knock it down.
Look, I understand too little too late. I realize there are things you say and do you can never take back. But what would you be if you didn't even try? You have to try. So after a lot of thought, I'd like to reconsider. Please, if it's not too late, make it a cheeseburger.
Gold and rose, the color of the dream I had not too long ago. A misty blue and the lilac, too, never to grow old. There you were under the tree of song, sleeping so peacefully. In your hand a flower played, awaiting there for me. I have never laid eyes on you, not before this timeless day, but you walked and you once smiled my name, and you stole my heart away.
We'd like to know a little bit about you for our files. We'd like to help you learn to help yourself. Look around you, all you see are sympathetic eyes. Stroll around the grounds until you feel at home.
If we do our job right, we never need to go to court. Look, the reason we're not a law firm? We don't have to play within the rules of the law. We're fixers, crisis managers. We make the problems of our clients go away, big or small. It's not about solving some crime, it's not about justice, it's about our client.
It wasn't always so clear, but the Rust programming language is fundamentally about empowerment: no matter what kind of code you are writing now, Rust empowers you to reach farther, to program with confidence in a wider variety of domains than you did before.
To sit among all those unknown things before a puzzle like that is hopeless. That way lies monomania. Face this world. Learn its ways, watch it, be careful of too hasty guesses at its meaning. In the end you will find clues to it all.
It is not difficult to wield a sword in one hand; the way to learn this is to train with two long swords, one in each hand. It will seem difficult at first, but everything is difficult at first.

I just finished this fascinating book. By the year 2030, there will be computers that can carry out the same amount of functions as an actual human brain. So theoretically, you could download your thoughts and memories into this computer and live forever as a machine!
If I can't find the cure, I'll fix you with my love. No matter what you know, I'll fix you with my love. And if you say you're okay, I'm gonna heal you anyway. Promise I'll always be there, promise I'll be the cure.
There was once a fish that lived in a pond. One day, he met another fish that used to live in the sea. The pond fish asked, "What is the sea?" and the sea fish said, "It is a vast amount of water that is a million, million times bigger than your pond." The pond fish never talked to the sea fish again because he thought the sea fish was a liar.
Well, isn't this great, we've all learned something. Tony can't choose who his sister's gonna fall for, Monica can't choose who she's gonna fall for, and I think that I've learned the greatest lesson of all. I love being lifted.
Very often research which has deeply interested me while I was investigating it loses its interest for me just after I have the solution, unhappily at a time which coincides with the period when I have to record it. After a while, say a couple of months, I come to a more just appreciation of it.
Really knowing is good. Not knowing, or refusing to know, is bad, or amoral, at least. You can't act if you don't know. Acting without knowing takes you right off the cliff.
Pork and beans are actually cooked in the can. One fairly large piece of pork is placed in the can before cooking. After being heated during processing, it melts down to the size you see in the can, its flavor having permeated the beans.
Are you sure? Fine! Well, you go and have a really good night's sleep then, I'm hoping to get a couple hours later on myself but I'll be up in good time to serve you your breakfast in bed. If you can remember to sleep with your mouth open you won't even have to wake up, I'll just drop in small pieces of lightly buttered kipper when you're breathing in the right direction if that doesn't put you out!
I distrust a close-mouthed man. He generally picks the wrong time to talk and says the wrong things. Talking's something you can't do judiciously, unless you keep in practice. Now, sir, we'll talk if you like. I'll tell you right out, I'm a man who likes talking to a man who likes to talk.
The number nine is not ten. The number eleven is not ten. Although the two numbers are almost ten, they can never be ten. They are untenable. You can add one to nine to make it ten, but it would no longer be nine! It would be ten! Same with eleven! When nine is nine and eleven is eleven, they are untenable! Their possessions are untenable! They have to go.
